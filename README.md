# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This webpage was designed to help bootcamp students have a location to store important notes as well as find motivation to study what they have learned to continue their growth. Along the way in developing this webpage, I learned how to code in HTML, CSS, and refreshed my understanding of JavaScript. I also learned how to navigate through the GITHub work flow which will be invaluable to me not only in this course, but also in my professional career as a developer and my personal code projects.

You will notice, when you oepn the page, four catagorys to enter notes into: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. These are the tenants of the course we will be taking and will provide the user space to store their class notes in each respective catagory. To use this page, you must be using a Google Chrome browser. With the page open in Google Chrome, right click anywhere on the page and navigate to the "inspect" option. in this page you can see the JavaScript code running. 

In future update, this page should include an entry box for students to log new notes to each catagory
